## Analysis
Every query in this project focused on exploring distinct facets of the data science job market. Below is an overview of my approach to each question:

### 1. Average Salary and Job Counts by Job Title
To analyze the job market, I aggregated data on various job titles by calculating their average yearly salaries and counting the number of job postings. I filtered out entries without a specified average salary to ensure accurate results. This query highlights the highest-paying roles across different job titles, allowing for insights into lucrative opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    
    job_title_short,                                     -- Select the short job title for display
    AVG(salary_year_avg) AS avg_salary,                 -- Calculate the average yearly salary for each job title
    COUNT(job_id) AS job_number                          -- Count the number of job postings for each job title
FROM 
    job_postings_fact                                   -- Specify the main table containing job postings
WHERE 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL                          -- Filter out job postings that do not have a specified average salary
GROUP BY 
    job_title_short                                     -- Group the results by the short job title to aggregate data
ORDER BY 
    avg_salary DESC                                     -- Order the results by average salary in descending order, showing highest salaries first

### 2. Top 20 Job Locations by Number of Jobs Posted
To evaluate the job market, I ranked various job locations by counting the total number of job postings. I filtered out any entries with null job locations to ensure the accuracy of the results. The query groups the data by job location and only includes those with at least one posting. This analysis highlights the top job locations based on demand, providing insights into where the most opportunities are available in the field.
```sql
SELECT
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(job_id) DESC) AS global_rank,  -- Assign global rank based on the count
      job_location,                                    -- Select the job location from the dataset
    COUNT(job_id) AS number_of_jobs                 -- Count the total number of job postings (job_id) for each location
FROM 
    job_postings_fact                                -- Specify the main table containing job postings
WHERE 
    job_location IS NOT NULL                         -- Filter out any entries where the job location is NULL
GROUP BY 
    job_location                                     -- Group results by job location to aggregate counts
HAVING 
    COUNT(job_id) > 0                               -- Ensure that only locations with at least one job posting are included
ORDER BY 
    number_of_jobs DESC                             -- Order the results by the count of job postings in descending order
LIMIT 20;                                            -- Limit the output to the top 20 locations

### 3. Top 20 Companies with the Highest Number of Remote Job Positions
To examine the landscape of remote job opportunities, I ranked companies based on the total number of job postings listed as "Anywhere." By joining the job postings table with the company dimension, I accessed relevant company details. This query aggregates job counts for each company, allowing for insights into which organizations are leading in offering remote positions. The results are sorted in descending order, highlighting the top companies with the most remote job openings.
```sql
SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(jp.job_id) DESC) AS global_rank,  -- Assign global rank based on the count
    c.name AS company_name,                     -- Retrieve the name of the company from the company dimension
    COUNT(jp.job_id) AS job_count              -- Count the number of job postings associated with each company

    job_postings_fact jp                        -- Specify the main table containing job postings
JOIN 
    company_dim c ON jp.company_id = c.company_id  -- Join with the company dimension table to access company details
WHERE 
    jp.job_location = 'Anywhere'                -- Filter for job postings that are listed as being located 'Anywhere'
GROUP BY 
    c.name                                      -- Group the results by company name to aggregate job counts
ORDER BY 
    job_count DESC                              -- Order the results by job count in descending order to identify top companies
LIMIT 20;                                       -- Limit the output to the top 20 companies with the most job postings

### 5. Top 20 In-Demand Skills for Data Scientists and Senior Data Scientists
To identify the top 20 skills in demand for Data Scientist and Senior Data Scientist roles, I constructed a query that calculates the demand for specific skills based on job postings for these positions. This involves using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to first count the occurrences of each skill in the job postings, then aggregate this demand data to differentiate between the two roles. The final output ranks the skills based on their demand counts, detailing the number of job postings requiring each skill for both job titles. This analysis provides valuable insights into the essential skills sought after by employers, enabling job seekers to focus on acquiring the most in-demand skills in the field of data science.


```sql
